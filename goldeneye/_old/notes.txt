goldeneye
---------
- aircraft: has cameras
- cameras: name, min/max alt, max roll/pitch, fov, duration, offset
- target exceptions: list of objects/statics?
- capture exceptions: list of objects

- dcsbot: addUserPoints?
- recon instances (per player): net.get_player_info -> playerID
- findTargets: frustrum search calc, unit/static/scenery
- set/remove marks: hp, pressure, type
- film loop
- ammo check?
- events: birth (slot change), dead (remove marks), takeoff (enable), land (result)

recon v2
--------
- airframes: has cameras
- cameras: name, typename, unitname, pitch, roll, yaw, horiz/vert fov, dist, infra, filmcount
- points per unit/infra
- markers
- low/high film?
- accuracy<threshold (hardcode), random offset ?

- return film: not in air + near friendly airbase
- capture units/statics: pyramid volume
- audit: add/remove markers
- markers: group, infra, aa
- events: lost/kill/dead (mark), birth (menu)

opsdcs-recon
------------
- camera defintions seperate
  - name
  - cameraType ("frame", "video")
  - mountType ("mounted", "handheld")
  - horizFOV, vertFOV
  - detectionRange
  - frameCount
  - frameInterval (0 = single frame, >0 = toggle on/off)
- aicraft definitions generic
  - unit type
  - list of cameras
    - name
    - x, y, z: position (only for mounted)
    - pitch, roll, yaw: orientation (only for mounted)
- convenient switches/toggles
  - bind space and backspace (SP only)
  - bind unused cockpit switch (SP only)
  - use f10 via voiceattack
  - use f10 via gremlin (joystick buttons)
- camera view mode
  - sets external cam and FOV/position/orientation
  - as additional command/toggle per camera
  - can take screenshots (configurable folder)
  - needs client hook (for MP)
- handheld camera
  - takes orientation from player camera
  - needs client hook (for MP)
    - PoC: f10 > server request caminfo via chatmsg > hook responds via chatmsg
- persistence
  - saves markers to file (desanitize io required)
  - loads markers from file (TBD: unclear.. except static positions?)
- recon-enable configurable
  - via group name prefix ("Recon")
  - via group task "reconnaissance"
- recon-audit configurable
  - via landed near airbase
  - via radio
- all configurable options additionally via zone params
- add hook (auto inject script into missions with certain prefix)
- add scoring
- add sounds

TBD: accuracy? persistence? realistic enable/audit? night? scoring?
